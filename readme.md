# STM

STM stands for "Services, Tools, and Modules". The goal of STM (pronounced
*stem*) is to provide a quick way to build a microservice architecture. STM is
extremely opinionated in its approaches as the goal of it is to minimize the
time spent in development and the time it takes to get to production. This
requires sacrificing in particular areas to maximize agility. For example, STM's
key focus will be around development in Node.js initially as Node.js offers
development agility in the fact that it is the one language that can be used for
frontend, backend, and devops.


## Provided by DEX

DEX is an organization centered around Developer Experience and Development
Agility. Like STM it is extremely opinionated in its approaches in order to
increase the rate at which software can be developed and grown.


## Core Concepts

There are several core concepts that drive STM:

 - Documentation Driven Services

    Documentation is a key differentiator in develoment agility. Developers can
be fast to create applications, but then that agility is silo'd into one
developer. Documentation enables entire organizations and it should always
exist.

 - Centralize and Refactor everything

    If you ever have to do anything more than once, then take the time to
consider how that something can be done a thousand times over. In the end, you
will be glad you did. Everything in this world is either unique or plentiful,
and if it exists more than once then we should expect it to multiply.
